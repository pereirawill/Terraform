AKS-managed Azure Active Directory integration

AKS-managed Azure AD integration is designed to simplify the Azure AD integration experience, where users were previously required to create a client app, a server app, and required the Azure AD tenant to grant Directory Read permissions. 
In the new version, the AKS resource provider manages the client and server apps for you.
